# Procedural Programming

- Focuses on procedures and functions to organize code

- Code is divided into smaller, manageable functions. Each function has a specific purpose, making code easier to understand

- Execution of the program has top-down design, where you start with Main and then potentially break down into smaller functions. 

- Make uses of flow control (for loop, if, while, etc) to control flow of execution

- Languages like C, Fortran and Pascal are built on procedural paradigm 

- Examples - calculators, cli utilities, control systems, etc.

# Disadvantages of Procedural:

- As program grows it becomes difficult to manage and maintain

- Sharing code with different projects difficult

- Rely on making variables global so that its accessible across all functions

- Doesn't naturally map to real-world entities, making modeling hard
