# Today - Classes and Objects: Review

# Procedural Programming

- Focuses on procedures and functions to organize code

- Code is divided into functions, where each function has a specific purpose

- Execution of the program has top-down design, start with main and break down into smaller functions.

- Make uses of flow control (for loop, if, while, etc) to control flow of execution

- Languages like C, Fortran and Pascal are built on procedural paradigm 

- Examples: calculators, cli utilities, control systems, etc.

# Disadvantages of Procedural:

- As program grows it becomes difficult to manage and maintain

- Sharing code with different projects difficult

- Rely on global variables to make data accessible across all functions

- Doesn't naturally map to real-world entities, making modeling hard
---
# Object Oriented Programming

- OOP is based on objects and everything is talked about in terms of objects
- Organizes code into reusable, self contained object
- Data and functions that operate on that data are encapsulated together in objects
- Represents real-world entities, making modeling easier
---

# What are Objects?

- Objects in a program are metaphors for real-world objects or entities (ie. Pen)
- Objects contains:
  - State - attributes of the object
  - Behavior - functionality or actions
- The process of creating objects is called **modeling**
