## Notes:
- Introduction to LINQ (41mins)
    - Agenda
        - Overview
        - Architecture
        - Query Syntax
        - Method Syntax
        - LINQ to Objects
        - LINQ to SQL
        - LINQ to XML
        - Best Practices
    - Overview
        - LINQ stands for Language Integrated Query 
        - It's a set of features in C# for querying and manipulating data
        - It allows to write queries directly in code (you can even write SQL like code)
            - query = set of instructions that describe what data to retrieve from a given data source
        - LINQ operates on data sources like Collections, Databases, XML and more
        - Has flexibility, providing you with two ways of writing queries
    - Query Syntax
        - Example
        ```
        
        
        
        ```
- Introduction to Collections (35mins)
    - System.Collections.Generic;
    - List<T> (T represents type; this is the generic type; comes from System.Collections.Generic; doesn't need to be resize like Arrays)
        - Add
        - AddRange
        - Capacity
        - Clear
        - Contains
        - Count
        - IndexOf
        - Insert (element at specific index)
        - Remove
        - RemoveAt (element at specific index)
        - RemoveRange
        - Sort
        - TrimExcess
    - 
    





- "The following examples demonstrate some simple LINQ queries by using each approach listed previously. In general, the rule is to use (Query syntax) whenever possible, and use (Method syntax) and (Mixed query and method syntax) whenever necessary."
