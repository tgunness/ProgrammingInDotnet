# Serialization (cont.)
- Problem: For instance, if the value "3" is read from a file, thereâ€™s no way to tell if the value came from an int, a string or a decimal. 
- Serialization can fix this problem as you are able to encode both data and information.
- Serialization is used in C# in various real-world scenarios to convert object data into a format that can be easily stored, transmitted, or reconstructed.
- Serialization in C# plays a crucial role in many industries as it allows data to be transformed into many portable formats that can be used across different systems and platforms.

- Example: When data needs to be sent over a network, it is often serialized into a format like JSON or XML before transmission. The receiving end deserializes the data to reconstruct the original object.
